# React

## Setup

One important thing to know about React is that it supports multiple platforms (for example, native and web). Each of these platforms has its own code necessary for interacting with that platform, and then there’s shared code between the platforms.

* React: responsible for creating React elements (kinda like `document.createElement()`)
* ReactDOM: responsible for rendering React elements to the DOM (kinda like `rootElement.append()`)
